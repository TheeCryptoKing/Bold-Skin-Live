          <h3 className="title-text">Researchers found in this study, which compared Rosemary Oil to Minoxidil (the active ingredient in Rogaine) that the natural remedy was just as effective OTC drug. Caffeine can help decrease DHT and increase growth factors as shown in this study. <br/> In another study they even boldly state in their title that "Peppermint Oil Promotes Hair Growth Without Toxic Signs"! <br/>There was even a randomized double blind trial that showed lavender, rosemary, thyme, cedarwood essential oils to be a safe and effective treatment of Alopecia Areata! <br/> Pumpkin seed oil can help reduce DHT and the study shows that it “provides evidence of a promising potential role of PSO in treating Female Pattern Hair Loss”. This shows us that natural remedies can be just as effective than the OTC in helping to promote hair growth and prevent hair loss! via(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25842469/)</h3>
